# Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the

# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout
#
# You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below:
# map key1>key2>key3 action
# For example:
map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20
# this will change the font size to 20 points when you press ctrl+f and then 2

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH

# an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or "red". WARNING: This option works by
# using a hack, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background
# color of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it is
# incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are
# probably better off just hiding the titlebar with macos_hide_titlebar.
